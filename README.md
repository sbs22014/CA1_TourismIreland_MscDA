# CA1_TourismIreland_MscDA

## Overview

This project aims to investigate the relationship between tourism and economic factors in the Republic of Ireland. Data sourced from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) will be utilized to analyze three economic factors (Household Income, Persons at Work, Disposable Income) and the amount of tourist amenities (Total Activities, Total Accommodation, Total Attractions) across 26 different regions (counties). The project will employ various data analytics techniques including Data Preparation and Visualization, Statistics, Machine Learning, and Programming to address specific questions and demonstrate best practices in data analytics.

## Data Source

The data for this project was obtained from the Irish Central Statistics Office on March 16th, 2024.

## Objectives

1. Explore the relationship between tourist amenity levels and economic factors.
2. Analyze the impact of economic factors on tourism across different regions.
3. Implement machine learning models to predict tourist amenity levels based on economic indicators.
4. Visualize the findings to communicate insights effectively.

## Approach

### Data Preparation and Visualization
- Clean and preprocess the data obtained from the CSO.
- Visualize the distribution of economic factors and tourist amenities across regions using charts and maps.
- Identify any patterns or correlations between variables.

### Statistics
- Conduct statistical analysis to quantify relationships between economic factors and tourist amenities.
- Calculate descriptive statistics to understand the central tendency and variability of the data.

### Machine Learning
- Apply supervised machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression to predict tourist amenity levels.
- Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

### Programming
- Utilize Python programming language and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
- Implement machine learning models using Scikit-learn library.

## Conclusion

By leveraging data analytics techniques, this project aims to provide insights into the relationship between tourism and economic factors in Ireland. The findings will contribute to understanding the factors influencing tourism and may inform strategic decision-making for tourism development and economic growth.
